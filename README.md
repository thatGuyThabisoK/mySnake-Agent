## Short description
Your snake agent is the red one going up against the other three snakes the objective of this game is to grow your agent longer than the other agents, the red snake implements A* search algorithm to the find the apple and if the apple is too far for the snake it will disregard it to safe on computational time(we are given 50ms to compute the location of the apple and make a move for every state/time step) and it will chase it's own tail if the target is too far or is no longer edible.
